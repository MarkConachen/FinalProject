# Block Breakers

## Repository
https://github.com/MarkConachen/FinalProject.git

## Description
What I will be creating is an Atari game called Breakout, which is where a ball slowly falls into a paddle that the player controls, and must break the blocks above with the ball. I chose this because it is the first game I ever played that sparked my interest in this field and it is relevant to media and digital arts because it is one of the originators of gaming.

## Features
- Feature 1:
  A ball that spawns in from which the player must control a paddle to deflect the ball back into blocks that break.

I am going to initalize a ball that spawns at a specific location on the screen and when you start the game it moves in a set direction with base speed. You will control a paddle at the bottom with left and right inputs (probably arrow keys) and when the ball hits a block, the direction is reversed causing it to come back down.

- Feature 2:
  Having a scoring system and different levels to keep the player engaged.

Every time the player breaks a block, the score increases by a set number of points. This number will stop increasing when the player fails, and or beats the game to reach a max score. The way to go to a next level will be determined if there are any remaining blocks on the screen and if not it will move onto the next level.

- Feature 3:
  Different power-ups that enhance the gameplay to make it more interesting.

Power-ups will be spawned randomly when a brick is destroyed up to a certain amount per level, and they will provide specific effects such as bigger paddle size, giving extra points multiplier, etc. They will fall slowly from a broken block, and can be collected by colliding with the paddle that the player controls.

## Challenges
- One of the most challenging things would be the game physics itself, making sure everything works smoothly and correctly.

- Implementing good user interface design, and making sure the scoring information is displaying correctly.

- Applying different levels and power-ups that are interesting and unique in design.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome is an engaing recreation of the Breakout game that showcases smooth and responsive gameplay, having a scoring system with different levels, having different power-ups that are unique, and visually it has a lot of effort put into it.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The minimum is a Breakout game that you control a paddle to hit blocks, but it has no scoring system, different levels, power-ups, and visually it is very bland.

## Milestones
- Week 1
1. Research and create the game mechanics which entail the paddle movement and ball physics.
2. Creating designs for the game itself such as basic graphics for the blocks, ball, and paddle.

- Week 2
1. Creating the main gameplay loop which allows the ball to interact with the paddle, and bounce up to hit the bricks.
2. Figuring out how to create the scoring system, power-ups, and new levels.

- Week N (Final)
1. Refining the gameplay mechanics to be more smooth, updating the visual quality, and ensuring power-ups, scoring system, and atleast another level is completed.
2. Playtesting my game and letting other people play as well to aquire feedback.
