## Description
My game Block Breakers is a direct inspiration from the Atari game "Breakout". You control a paddle at the bottom of the screen using the left and right arrow keys to reflect a ball into blocks that are above you. There are two types of blocks, ones that have specific colors tied to the level and gray blocks that do not offer
points whenever the ball collides with them. Whenever the ball collides with a breakable block, there is a chance for a power-up to spawn. The two power-ups I implemented were two ball spawns, and a way to increase the paddle size for 10 seconds. These power-ups are designed to make the levels easier to complete, and yes they
do stack effects on top of each other. I made 4 levels, all of which was done in a seperate level.txt file through ASCII art which is so cool and did not know I could do it that way. It allowed me to customize my own levels to my liking and it was very efficient. After completing level 1, you advance to the next level automatically
and clear the screen of all power-ups and balls that were from the previous level. If the ball ever reaches below your paddle a "Game Over!" screen will show, and also total your final score as well as putting it into the terminal.

 As you may notice there are different files included in this project such as "powerup1.png" and "powerup2.png". I applied what I learned from previous lessons to make the power-up icons more appealing to look at instead of just a falling solid color block and explaining it that way.I wanted to keep the game as simple looking as
 I could however, as I felt a personal attachment to this project as it was inspired from the first game I have ever played. I also designed it that way so that people could maybe experience playing a video game for the first time and not be overwhelmed by the visual clutter. As I stated before I originally just had rows and columns
 with blocks that offered points when you collided with them, but I learned how to make a level through the level.txt files, and I wanted to make truly unique levels that are different from the original game. 

 As for future improvements I would add sounds such as the ball colliding against the bricks, paddle, and walls, as well as power-up aquisition noises. Although I wanted to really keep the idea as simple as possible it would be cool to add transitional effects from going to different levels. I also think making more power-ups that are
 very unique in gameplay but keeping the old-school style of this game would be ideal. 

Overall this project was an accumulation of knowledge I learned over the semester as a beginner coder, and I really did enjoy this project to it's full potential. I learned new techniques through this project and did my fair share of documentation diving (tm) to help assist me in creating a game that got me into this field to begin with.
There were a lot of challenges that made me doubt if I could really implement some of the features correctly and not have a empty shell of a game to showcase. I truly hope you enjoyed watching (and or playing) my game, and atleast it showcased a reimagination of the Atari game Breakout.
