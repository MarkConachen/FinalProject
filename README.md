# Block Breakers

## Repository
https://github.com/MarkConachen/FinalProject.git

## Description
What I will be creating is an Atari game called Breakout, which is where a ball slowly falls into a paddle that the player controls, and must break the blocks above with the ball. I chose this because it is the first game I ever played that sparked my interest in this field and it is relevant to media and digital arts because it is one of the originators of gaming.

## Features
- Feature 1:
  A ball that spawns in from which the player must control a paddle to deflect the ball back into blocks that break.

- Feature 2
  Having a scoring system and different levels to keep the player engaged.

- Feature 3
  Different power-ups that enhance the gameplay to make it more interesting.

## Challenges
- One of the most challenging things would be the game physics itself, making sure everything works smoothly and correctly.

- Implementing good user interface design, and making sure the scoring information is displaying correctly.

- Applying different levels and power-ups that are interesting and unique in design.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome is an engaing recreation of the Breakout game that showcases smooth and responsive gameplay, having a scoring system with different levels, having different power-ups that are unique, and visually it has a lot of effort put into it.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The minimum is a Breakout game that you control a paddle to hit blocks, but it has no scoring system, different levels, power-ups, and visually it is very bland.

## Milestones
- Week 1
Goal 1: Research and create the game mechanics which entail the paddle movement and ball physics.
Goal 2: Creating designs for the game itself such as basic graphics for the blocks, ball, and paddle.

- Week 2
Goal 1: Creating the main gameplay loop which allows the ball to interact with the paddle, and bounce up to hit the bricks.
Goal 2: Figuring out how to create the scoring system, power-ups, and new levels.

- Week N (Final)
Goal 1: Refining the gameplay mechanics to be more smooth, updating the visual quality, and ensuring power-ups, scoring system, and atleast another level is completed.
Goal 2: Playtesting my game and letting other people play as well to aquire feedback.
